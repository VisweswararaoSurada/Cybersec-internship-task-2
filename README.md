# Cybersecurity Internship - Task 2
**Task:** Analyze a Phishing Email Sample

## Objective
Analyze a suspicious email to identify phishing indicators and learn how to verify sender authenticity, inspect headers, and spot social-engineering tricks.

## What I Did
1. Collected a sample phishing-style email (saved as `phishing_email_sample.txt`).  
2. Examined the sender address and email headers for spoofing indicators.  
3. Checked links and attachments (did not click any links).  
4. Looked for urgency, grammar errors, and mismatched URLs.  
5. Summarized the phishing traits and recommended actions.

## Tools I Used
- text editor   
- Online header analyzer (MXToolbox Header Analyzer)  
- Browser (hovered links without opening)  
- Screenshot tool for evidence

## Files in this repo
- `phishing_email_sample.txt` — raw email content analyzed  
- `analysis_report.md` — my detailed findings and remediation steps  
- `screenshots/` — (optional) screenshots of header analysis or link checks

## Submission Notes
- I did not click links or open attachments.  
- All analysis is based on headers, visible links, and email body content.
